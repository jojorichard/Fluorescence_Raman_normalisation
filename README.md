# ‚ö° Fluorescence spectroscopy analysis ‚ö°

This package is a tool for processing Excitation Emission Matrix (EEM). It includes several functions such as fluorescence normalisation based on the Raman peak of water. The ability to remove the first and second order Rayleigh scattering and the plotting of several graphs is also included. The contained graphs are the following: 2D graphs, 3D contourplots and surfaceplots for data visualisation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Creating a new environment before installing the present package is recommended to ensure a smooth continuation and prevent any unwanted conflit.
```
pip install git+https://github.com/jojorichard/Fluorescence_Raman_normalisation.git
```
To install it, you can copy paste the command above in your terminal or anaconda prompt depending on your computer.
### Import package
```
import EEM
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development installation

You can also clone this repository locally from GitHub:
```
git clone https://github.com/jojorichard/Fluorescence_Raman_normalisation.git .
```
Then add and commit changes as usual. 

Contributions from third parties are welcomed. Indeed, the implementation of a new function reading new file formats would be greatly be appreciated. To see how to implement it, please refer to [Implementation](https://github.com/jojorichard/Fluorescence_Raman_normalisation/blob/main/documentation/Implementation_of_a_new_file_format.md) in the documentation section.

## üîé Run test and coverage

```
(conda_env) $ pip install tox
(conda_env) $ tox
```
